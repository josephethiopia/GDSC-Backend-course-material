Questions that I asked:

1. Does the following code generate a unique sessionID per user?
2. Is the id sent to the user as a cookie?
3. Does the server store temporary data about the user?
4. Is the sessionID being sent to the user after each request?

Answers that I got

1. Yes, the express-session middleware handles this automatically
2. Yes, expess-session middleware makes us of cookies
3. Yes, loggedIn and items are stored in the users session
4. Not exactly:
    - First request: the ID is generated and sent to the user in the connect.sid cookie
    - On subsequent request: the connect.sid cookie is sent back to the server and data is extracted
